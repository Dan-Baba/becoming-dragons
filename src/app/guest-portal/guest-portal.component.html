        Well, it sure does look like you are one of the chosen ones. Welcome, wedding guest! As our guest, we wanted to give you access to all the details you may need for our big day. If you should have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

        ON THE DAY DETAILS We're currently still pinning down the nitty gritty, but we will keep this section updated as we know more.
    </p>

    <!-- Who what where when -->

    <h4>DRESS ATTIRE</h4>
    <p>
        We wantyou to feel comfortable. By no means will this be a black tie affair, nor will either of us be in jeans or camo. 
        This should give you a prettty good idea: We (wedding party) will be somewhere in the realm of cocktail/normal to casual 
        wedding attire (no jackets, add in a tie or two). Shoes? Again, keep them comfortable, we're planning on an outdoor wedding 
        in June, so plan to possibly get a little muddy. This isn't the time for your designer brands or heels. Now you know what we'll 
        be wearing; whether you wanna fit in or stick out like a unicorn--we want you to be there. You do you.
    </p>

    <h4>RSVP</h4>
    <p>
        If you're not sure yet--no worries-- we will be sending official wedding invitations in the mail, so you've got some time. 
        But if you're one of those overachiever types and you want to RSVP before you receive it--be our guest (yes, pun intended; 
        simply click here, and thank you for your advanced notice!). Side note: we will be kindly asking everyone on the invite to RSP online anyway, 
        so that we can save some time, money and carbon emissions.
    </p>
