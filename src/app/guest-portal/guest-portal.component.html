        <!-- Who what where when -->

        <h4 class="shit-color">DRESS ATTIRE</h4>
        <p>
            We want you to feel comfortable. By no means will this be a black tie affair, nor will either of us be in jeans or camo. This should give you a pretty good idea: We (wedding party) will be somewhere in the realm of cocktail/normal to casual wedding attire
            (no jackets, add in a tie or two). Shoes? Again, keep them comfortable, we’re also planning on an outdoor wedding in June, so plan to possibly get a little muddy. This isn’t the time for your designer brands or heels. Now you know what we’ll
            be wearing; whether you wanna fit in or stick out like a unicorn—we want you to be there. You do you.
        </p>

        <h4 class="shit-color">RSVP</h4>
        <p>
            If you’re not sure yet—no worries—we will be sending official wedding invitations in the mail, so you’ve got some time. But if you’re one of those overachiever types and you want to RSVP before you receive it—be our guest (yes, pun intended; simply
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0Trwk3uejI0t8HKdI0S0heHIOPPkfrGB4SXQnjcTdROtwKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">click here</a>, and thank you for the advanced notice!). Side note: We will be kindly asking everyone
            on the invite to RSVP online anyway, so that we can save some time, money and carbon emissions.
        </p>

        <h4 class="shit-color">REGISTRY/HONEYMOON</h4>
        <p>
            We are honored you will share in our special day. Your presence is a gift! Please enjoy browsing our wishlist on huneyfund.com, where you can contribute to our dream honeymoon!
        </p>

        <h4 class="shit-color">TRAVELING?</h4>
        <p>
            Friends and family near and far, we want to help make your trip to beautiful Upstate New York a memorable one.
        </p>

        <h5>Flying?</h5>
        <span class="shit-color">Albany International Airport</span><br /> Albany Shaker Rd, Colonie, NY<br /> If you're flying in, this is the airport closest to us; we are about 35 miles north.

        <h5>HOTELS IN THE AREA</h5>
        <p>
            We will have blocks of rooms at a couple of hotels in the area--coming soon! Safety is our number one priority; each of the hotels on our list will be within a short Uber ride from our venue. We'll keep this section updated as we know more.
        </p>

        <h5>THINGS TO DO IN AND AROUND TOWN, PLUS MORE</h5>
        <p>
            There is so much to do where we live and in the surrounding areas. Our wedding will most likely be held in Schuylerville, NY, and to our home in Victory Mills, NY. It’s a 15-minute drive into Saratoga Springs, NY, and 45 minutes to Albany, NY, our state’s
            capital. It is also at the base of the Adirondack mountains, 2.5 hours from Burrlington, VT, 3.5 hours from NYC, 3.5 hours from Boston, MA, 4 hours from Montreal, Canada, 4.5 hours from Philadelphia, PA, and 5 hours from Niagara Falls, NY.
            Here are some of our favorite day trips:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Springs, NY </span><br /> Play tourist in the city Gwen grew up in; whether you are from here or not, there is always something new to find in Saratoga. Fun fact: Potato chips were invented in Saratoga Springs,
            NY!
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Performing Arts Center</span> (or SPAC) in <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Spa State Park</span><br /> 108 Avenue of the Pines, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 Located inside a beautiful New York State Park,
            this indoor/outdoor concert venue is a great spot to visit while you’re in town. Find a concert or just walk around!
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Roosevelt Baths & Spa</span> in <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Spa State Park</span><br /> 39 Roosevelt Dr, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 Also located inside the park but deserves its own callout. If you are a Saratoga
            Springs resident, you get a discount on baths and spa services. If you are from out of town, at least check out the mineral baths. Saratoga Springs is one of only a few places in the world with naturally occurring carbonated mineral spring
            water. You can also taste the spring water by visiting the different springs around the park and in Saratoga’s downtown Congress Park.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga’s Downtown</span><br />
            <strong>Congress Park, 1 E Congress St, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866</strong><br /> I would start and end with Congress Park (across the street is the Visitor’s Center). Downtown is home to more naturally occurring springs, the Canfield Casino
            (take a historic tour), the carousel, awesome local shops and restaurants, as well as where Gwen and Dan both work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Outside of Saratoga</span><br /> Schuylerville, NY/Victory Mills, NY, is a beautiful and historic area. If you’re into taking long walks and/or history, this is the place for you. General Schuyler’s house, Saratoga
            Monument and Victory Woods are right down the road from Gwen and Dan’s home—practically in their backyard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga National Historical Park (Saratoga Battlefield)</span><br /> <strong>648 NY-32, Stillwater, NY 12170</strong><br /> Here, in 1777, during the American War for Independence, American troops battled and beat
            a British invasion force, marking the first time in world history that a British Army ever surrendered. These are beautiful grounds for walking, running, biking and learning some American history along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Ithaca, NY</span><br />Gwen’s home away from home. Ithaca is known for its nature, beautiful natural gorges, waterfalls (Taughannock Falls State Park is Gwen’s favorite), hikes, state parks, the Finger Lakes and wine.
            “Ithaca is gorges” is not only a perfect tagline but is also so true.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="shit-color">Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (Mass MoCA)</span><br /> <strong>1040 Mass MoCA Way, North Adams, MA 01247</strong><br /> Contemporary art museum in a quaint little town in Massachusetts. Gwen likes to make
            the trip at least once a year, usually around her birthday.
        </p>
        <h5>GOOD EATS</h5>
        <p>
            This is a list of some of our favorite places to eat:<br />
            <span class="shit-color">Revolution Cafe</span>—Cassie, the owner, is catering our wedding, tell her we sent you! Fun fact: Gwen also designed their logo and branding. Try a burrito! <br />
            <span class="shit-color">The Olde Bryan Inn</span>—Where Gwen and Dan first met, delicious comfort food. French onion soup is a must-have. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Kru Coffee</span>—Hipsters love it and so do we, great coffee, chill vibe. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Coffee Traders</span>—Home of Death Wish Coffee. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Tea and Honey</span>—If you’re a tea fanatic, this place is for you. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Uncommon Grounds</span>—Great bagels, coffee, lattes and tea. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Eatery</span>—All-around great food. Druthers—They make their own beer and have elevated pub food. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Sweeney’s</span>—Best pancakes and homemade doughnuts around. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Saratoga Gluten Free Goods</span>—If you are a gluten-free eater, this place is a must. Gwen also designed their logo and branding. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Roma</span>—Best subs you’ll ever eat! I. Promise. The Ripe Tomato—Sunday brunch. All. The. Way. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Chianti or Forno Bistro</span>—Upscale Italian food and oh so tasty. <br />
            <span class="shit-color">Gennaro’s Pizza & Mama Mia’s</span>—Best two pizza joints in town.
        </p>

        <h4>Wedding Party</h4>
        <p>
            You’ll notice in sticking with the nontraditional, we’ve chosen some different titles for our wedding party—don’t be alarmed, be open!<br />(OK, so no fancy nontraditional title here, but we are changing our last name to Dragon, so…)
